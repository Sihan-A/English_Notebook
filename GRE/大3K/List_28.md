simile

n.明喻a figure of speech comparing two unlike things that is often introduced by like or as

【例】Even though both similes and metaphors are forms of comparison, similes indirectly compare the two ideas and allow them to remain distinct in spite of their similarities, whereas metaphors compare two things directly. For instance, a simile that compares a person with a bullet would go as follows: "Chris was a record-setting runner as fast as a speeding bullet. "A metaphor might read something like, "When Chris ran, he was a speeding bullet racing along the track."尽管明喻和暗喻都是比喻的手法，明喻会间接地对两个对象进行比较，同时允许差异的存在，而暗喻则直接对两者进行比较比如说，用明喻来把一个人比作子弹会这样说“克里斯是一个不断打破记录的选手，他跑得就和高速子弹一样快”而暗喻可能会说“当克里斯奔跑的时候，他就是一颗在赛场上高速飞行的子弹”
